# Job tracker

Job tracker is an application that's designed to help people organise, manage and track their job applications throughout the hiring process. It provides centralized platform to keep all job-related information organized and easily accessible. This is a Full-Stack application using a Rails API with a React Front-End and was built in during the final two weeks of my Software Engineering Bootcamp with <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/london">General Assembly</a>.
